Word Count Tool is incredibly easy to use and can give you almost instantaneous results. It will show you the word count for the number of words, characters, sentences, and paragraphs.

It also works as a character count tool and can be used to perform word count for Google Docs, PDF files, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Powerpoint, Adobe InDesign, and many more. All you need to do is copy the text from any file types or websites and paste it into the Word Counter Tool input box.

Word Counter Tool can calculate how many words in a paragraph and even calculate the total word count for a novel, essay, or books. There is no limit to how many words you would like to count. It can also be useful if you have a maximum limit to the number of words allowed for an article or blog post you are working on.

Unlike most other word counter tools, our Word Counter Tool does not set any limit to the amount of text you wish to count. It is completely free to use with no limits to the number of times you would like to use it
